PROJECT TITLE: Intelligent Tutor for Personalised Learning


A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT: Develop an intelligent tutor that will create personalised learning path based on individual strengths, weaknesses, and
learning styles.It will also provide personalized feedback, guidance, and support to students. Also it can provide adaptive assignments based on the student's
performance.


INPUT OF THE PROJECT: Student's profile with informations such as strength, goals, weakness, learning style, interest, etc.


OUTPUT OF THE PROJECT: Personalised learning path, feedback, adaptive assessments, progress report.


USE CASE OF THE PROJECT: Students can use this as a personal teacher to educate themselves with proper guidance and support that will not only teach them but also
track their progress, give them feedbacks and reports so that they can work on those areas where they are lagging.
It will also give assignments based on the mental abilty and progress.

PROJECT TITLE: Secure Password Management System with Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Integration


A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT: Develop a secure password management system that not only enables users to store and manage their passwords securely but also
integrates two-factor                   authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security. 


INPUT OF THE PROJECT:

  User-provided passwords with prefrences of complexity and length
  User preferences for 2FA methods (e.g., SMS, authenticator apps, hardware tokens)


OUTPUT OF THE PROJECT:

  Password generation and storage in encrypted and centralized password repository
  Integration with chosen 2FA methods for enhanced authentication


USE CASE OF THE PROJECT: 

  Both strong passwords and multi-factor authentication for granting access, 
  Secure storage and password management, 
  Secure access and synchronization with devices reducing risk
